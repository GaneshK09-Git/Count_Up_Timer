⏫ Count-Up Timer:

A simple Python program that counts up from a starting number to an ending number, pausing for one second between each count.

Features:

- Starts counting from a given start value

- Stops counting at a specified end value

- Delays by 1 second between each number

- Displays "Done!" when finished

How It Works:
1. The program defines a count() function with:

2. end → the number at which counting stops

3. start → the number from which counting begins (default is 0)

4. It prints each number in sequence with a 1-second pause.

5. After reaching the end value, it prints "Done!".

Requirements:

- Python 3.x

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/count-up-timer.git
2. Navigate into the project folder:
